            Dear Hiring Team at Ludeon Studios,<br><br>

            I was 12 years old when I first started following the development of RimWorld, and watching it evolve from early Alpha builds to its full release was a major catalyst in my decision to pursue game development. I am writing to apply for the Junior Programmer position, bringing with me a passion for emergent storytelling and a strong technical foundation in game architecture.<br><br>

            Beyond the code, I understand that games are not just challenges to be beaten, but mediums for storytelling. As a Dungeon Master for tabletop RPGs in my spare time, I know that the best mechanics are the ones that facilitate drama and personal investment. I want to build systems that allow players to tell their own stories, just as RimWorld has done for me for nearly a decade.<br><br>

            Technically, my background allows me to contribute specialized knowledge in optimization. While my recent professional focus has been on C++ and low-level graphics, this has given me a deep understanding of engine architecture that translates directly to high-performance C# development. I am currently developing my own rendering framework, specifically to master the optimization techniques required to keep complex simulations running smoothly.<br><br>

            Currently, I am working as a Game Developer Intern at <i>Paleta Cenografia</i>, where I engineer interactive real-time systems in Unreal Engine 5 and develop automation scripts to improve studio workflows. I am eager to bring this professional discipline and my lifelong passion for your games to the team.<br><br>

            Thank you for your time and for creating the games that inspired me to become a developer. I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the future of Ludeon Studios.<br><br>

            Sincerely,<br>

            Miguel Pafume Rodrigues
